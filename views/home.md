## Getting started

This is the dashboard for the [Serpent OS](https://serpentos.com) build infrastructure.
In order to contribute, visit the [documentation](https://docs.serpentos.com) and open a PR to the [recipes](https://github.com/serpent-os/recipes) repository on GitHub.

### Current status

This is a legacy implementation of the Serpent OS infrastructure, we're currently working on a port
to Rust to match our shiny new [tooling](https://github.com/serpent-os/moss-rs.git)
